summary:: A subsample-accurate granular feedback delay
related:: Classes/GrainBuf, Classes/DelayN
categories:: UGens>Delays, UGens>Granular

description::
A real-time granular delay effect with subsample-accurate grain triggering and single-sample feedback. 
Each grain can be pitch-shifted and overlapped to create complex textures ranging from subtle echoes to dense granular clouds. 
The plugin uses a sub-sample accurate event system for precise grain timing, eliminating aliasing for high trigger rates and supports up to 32 active grains with smart voice allocation.
The voice allocation system distributes each grain across the 32 available channels and checks which channel is currently free, dropping grains only when all channels are busy. 
This ensures that no grains are scheduled on a channel which is currently active.

note::
High overlap values require more CPU as more grains are active simultaneously

classmethods::

method::ar

argument::input
Audio input signal to be processed

argument::triggerRate
Grain trigger rate in Hz. Controls the density of grain scheduling.

argument::overlap
Grain overlap amount. The higher the overlap amount, the more the grains overlap up to the maximum number of 32 channels.
Range: 0.001-32
Default: 1

argument::delayTime
Delay time in seconds. Determines how far back in the buffer grains are read from.
Range: 1 sample - 5 seconds
Default: 0.2 seconds

argument::grainRate
Grain playback rate. 1.0 = normal speed, 0.5 = half speed (lower pitch), 2.0 = double speed (higher pitch).
Range: 0.125-4.0
Default: 1.0

argument::mix
Dry/wet mix control. 0 = dry signal only, 1 = wet signal only.
Range: 0-1
Default: 0.5

argument::feedback
Feedback amount. Controls how much of the processed signal is fed back into the delay buffer.
Range: 0-0.99
Default: 0

argument::damping
High-frequency damping in the feedback path. 0 = bright feedback, 1 = dark feedback.
Range: 0-1
Default: 0

argument::freeze
When 1, freezes the delay buffer - no new input is recorded, allowing infinite manipulation of the captured audio.
Range: 0-1 (binary)
Default: 0

argument::reset
Trigger to reset all grain state and clear the delay buffer.
Range: 0-1 (trigger)
Default: 0

returns:: Processed audio signal
